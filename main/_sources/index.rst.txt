Mighty is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) library that aims to make training general agents easy.
We natively support context in RL, i.e. train and test distributions that can be easily configured, as well
as DAC, dynamic hyperparameter configuration using contextual RL.
That means if you're interested in general RL, you can start with well-known simulation environments and scale up
to actually applications using Mighty!

Currently Mighty is in early development and includes only standard RL algorithms compatible with cRL benchmarks and
evaluation mechanisms. In the future, we hope to extend mighty with Meta-Learning methods as well as AutoRL, so stay tuned.
